  abstract = {We describe a multi-purpose image classifier that can be applied to a wide variety of image classification tasks without modifications or fine-tuning, and yet provide classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art task-specific image classifiers. The proposed image classifier first extracts a large set of 1025 image features including polynomial decompositions, high contrast features, pixel statistics, and textures. These features are computed on the raw image, transforms of the image, and transforms of transforms of the image. The feature values are then used to classify test images into a set of pre-defined image classes. This classifier was tested on several different problems including biological image classification and face recognition. Although we cannot make a claim of universality, our experimental results show that this classifier performs as well or better than classifiers developed specifically for these image classification tasks. Our classifier's high performance on a variety of classification problems is attributed to (i) a large set of features extracted from images; and (ii) an effective feature selection and weighting algorithm sensitive to specific image classification problems. The algorithms are available for free download from openmicroscopy.org.},

At present, there is great interest in the association of brain microvessels, astrocytes and neurons to form functional 'neurovascular units', and recent studies have highlighted the importance of brain endothelial cells in this modular organization. Here, we explore specific interactions between the brain endothelium, astrocytes and neurons that may regulate blood-brain barrier function. An understanding of how these interactions are disturbed in pathological conditions could lead to the development of new protective and restorative therapies.},

Transgenic loss-of-function studies reveal that astrocyte borders and scars serve as functional barriers that restrict the entry of inflammatory cells into CNS parenchyma in health and disease. Astrocytes also have powerful pro-inflammatory potential. Thus, astrocytes are emerging as pivotal regulators of CNS inflammatory responses. This Review discusses evidence that astrocytes have crucial roles in attracting and restricting CNS inflammation, with important implications for diverse CNS disorders.},

  abstract    = {Reactive astrogliosis, whereby astrocytes undergo varying molecular and morphological changes, is a ubiquitous but poorly understood hallmark of all central nervous system pathologies. Genetic tools are now enabling the molecular dissection of the functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis in vivo. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that reactive astrogliosis can exert both beneficial and detrimental effects in a context-dependent manner determined by specific molecular signaling cascades. Reactive astrocytes can have both loss of normal functions and gain of abnormal effects that could feature prominently in a variety of disease processes. This article reviews developments in the signaling mechanisms that regulate specific aspects of reactive astrogliosis and highlights the potential to identify novel therapeutic molecular targets for diverse neurological disorders.},

  abstract    = {Glial scar formation around implanted silicon neural probes compromises their ability to facilitate long-term recordings. One approach to modulate the tissue reaction around implanted probes in the brain is to develop probe coatings that locally release anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we developed a nitrocellulose-based coating for the local delivery of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (DEX). Silicon neural probes with and without nitrocellulose-DEX coatings were implanted into rat brains, and inflammatory response was evaluated 1 week and 4 weeks post implantation. DEX coatings significantly reduced the reactivity of microglia and macrophages 1 week post implantation as evidenced by ED1 immunostaining. CS56 staining demonstrated that DEX treatment significantly reduced chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) expression 1 week post implantation. Both at 1-week and at 4-week time points, GFAP staining for reactive astrocytes and neurofilament (NF) staining revealed that local DEX treatment significantly attenuated astroglial response and reduced neuronal loss in the vicinity of the probes. Weak ED1, neurocan, and NG2-positive signal was detected 4 weeks post implantation for both coated and uncoated probes, suggesting a stabilization of the inflammatory response over time in this implant model. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the nitrocellulose-DEX coating can effectively attenuate the inflammatory response to the implanted neural probes, and reduce neuronal loss in the vicinity of the coated probes. Thus anti-inflammatory probe coatings may represent a promising approach to attenuate astroglial scar and reduce neural loss around implanted neural probes.},

  abstract    = {Prosthetic devices that are controlled by intracortical electrodes recording one's 'thoughts' are a reality today, and no longer merely in the realm of science fiction. However, widespread clinical use of implanted electrodes is hampered by a lack of reliability in chronic recordings, independent of the type of electrodes used. One major hypothesis has been that astroglial scar electrically impedes the electrodes. However, there is a temporal discrepancy between stabilization of scar's electrical properties and recording failure with recording failure lagging by 1 month. In this study, we test a possible explanation for this discrepancy: the hypothesis that chronic inflammation, due to the persistent presence of the electrode, causes a local neurodegenerative state in the immediate vicinity of the electrode. Through modulation of chronic inflammation via stab wound, electrode geometry and age-matched control, we found that after 16 weeks, animals with an increased level of chronic inflammation were associated with increased neuronal and dendritic, but not axonal, loss. We observed increased neuronal and dendritic loss 16 weeks after implantation compared to 8 weeks after implantation, suggesting that the local neurodegenerative state is progressive. After 16 weeks, we observed axonal pathology in the form of hyperphosphorylation of the protein tau in the immediate vicinity of the microelectrodes (as observed in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies). The results of this study suggest that a local, late onset neurodegenerative disease-like state surrounds the chronic electrodes and is a potential cause for chronic recording failure. These results also inform strategies to enhance our capability to attain reliable long-term recordings from implantable electrodes in the CNS.},

To examine these hypotheses, the spatial distribution of biomarkers associated with the foreign body response to insulated microwires placed in rat cerebral cortex was analyzed 2, 4, and 12 weeks after implantation using quantitative methods. We observed a stereotypical tissue response that was similar in some aspects to that previously reported for penetrating planar silicon microelectrode arrays with some specific differences including an overall lower degree of cortical tissue reactivity. While we found no evidence that reactive gliosis increases over time or that neuronal loss is progressive, we did find evidence of persistent inflammation and enhanced BBB permeability at the electrode brain tissue interface that extended over the 3 month indwelling period and that exhibited more animal to animal variability at 3 months than at 2 and 4 weeks.},

  abstract    = {An estimated 25 million people in the US alone rely on implanted medical devices, ?2.5 million implanted within the nervous system. Even though many devices perform adequately for years, the host response to medical devices often severely limits tissue integration and long-term performance. This host response is believed to be particularly limiting in the case of intracortical microelectrodes, where it has been shown that glial cell encapsulation and localized neuronal cell loss accompany intracortical microelectrode implantation. Since neuronal ensembles must be within ?50 µm of the electrode to obtain neuronal spikes and local field potentials, developing a better understanding of the molecular and cellular environment at the device-tissue interface has been the subject of significant research. Unfortunately, immunohistochemical studies of scar maturation in correlation to device function have been inconclusive. Therefore, here we present a detailed quantitative study of the cellular events and the stability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following intracortical microelectrode implantation and cortical stab injury in a chronic survival model. We found two distinctly inverse multiphasic profiles for neuronal survival in device-implanted tissue compared to stab-injured animals. For chronically implanted animals, we observed a biphasic paradigm between blood-derived/trauma-induced and CNS-derived inflammatory markers driving neurodegeneration at the interface. In contrast, stab injured animals demonstrated a CNS-mediated neurodegenerative environment. Collectively these data provide valuable insight to the possibility of multiple roles of chronic neuroinflammatory events on BBB disruption and localized neurodegeneration, while also suggesting the importance to consider multiphasic neuroinflammatory kinetics in the design of therapeutic strategies for stabilizing neural interfaces.},

In this study a computational modeling approach was used to design a diffusion sink placed at the device surface that would retain pro-inflammatory cytokines for sufficient time to passively antagonize their impact on the FBR. Using quantitative immunohistochemistry, we examined the FBR to such engineered devices after a 16-week implantation period in the cortex of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results indicate that thick permeable surface coatings, which served as diffusion sinks, significantly reduced the FBR compared to implants either with no coating or with a thinner coating. The results suggest that increasing surface permeability of solid implanted devices to create a diffusion sink can be used to reduce the FBR and improve biocompatibility of chronic indwelling devices in brain tissue.},

  abstract    = {Brain implants provide exceptional tools to understand and restore cerebral functions. The utility of these devices depends crucially on their biocompatibility and long term viability. We addressed these points by implanting non-functional, NeuroProbes silicon probes, without or with hyaluronic acid (Hya), dextran (Dex), dexamethasone (DexM), Hya+DexM coating, into rat neocortex. Light and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate neuronal survival and glial response. The surface of explanted probes was examined in the scanning electron microscope. We show that blood vessel disruption during implantation could induce considerable tissue damage. If, however, probes could be inserted without major bleeding, light microscopical evidence of damage to surrounding neocortical tissue was much reduced. At distances less than 100 microm from the probe track a considerable neuron loss ( approximately 40\%) occurred at short survival times, while the neuronal numbers recovered close to control levels at longer survival. Slight gliosis was observed at both short and long term survivals. Electron microscopy showed neuronal cell bodies and synapses close (<10 microm) to the probe track when bleeding could be avoided. The explanted probes were usually partly covered by tissue residue containing cells with different morphology. Our data suggest that NeuroProbes silicon probes are highly biocompatible. If major blood vessel disruption can be avoided, the low neuronal cell loss and gliosis should provide good recording and stimulating results with future functional probes. We found that different bioactive molecule coatings had small differential effects on neural cell numbers and gliosis, with optimal results achieved using the DexM coated probes.},

We found that the reaction surrounding transcranially implanted HFMs was significantly greater than that observed with intraparenchymally implanted materials including increases in immunoreactivity against GFAP, vimentin, ED-1 labeled macrophages and microglia, and several extracellular matrix proteins including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. In general, these markers were elevated along the entire length of transcranially implanted HFMs extending into the adjacent parenchyma up to 0.5 mm from the implant interface. Intraparenchymal implants did not appear to have significant involvement of a fibroblastic component as suggested by a decreased expression of vimentin, fibronectin and collagen-type I at the implant tissue interface. The increase in tissue reactivity observed with transcranially implanted HFMs may be influenced by several mechanisms including chronic contact with the meninges and possibly motion of the device within brain tissue. Broadly speaking, our results suggest that any biomaterial, biosensor or device that is anchored to the skull and in chronic contact with meningeal tissue will have a higher level of tissue reactivity than the same material completely implanted within brain tissue.},

  abstract    = {Implantable neural electrodes must drastically improve chronic recording stability before they can be translated into long-term human clinical prosthetics. Previous studies suggest that sub-cellular sized and mechanically compliant probes may result in improved tissue integration and recording longevity. However, currently these design features are restricted by the opposing mechanical requirements needed for minimally damaging insertions. We designed a non-cytotoxic, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) based dissolvable delivery vehicle (shuttle) to provide the mechanical support for insertion of ultra-small, ultra-compliant microfabricated neural probes. Stiff CMC-based shuttles rapidly soften immediately after being placed ?1 mm above an open craniotomy as they absorb vapors from the brain. To address this, we developed a sophisticated targeting, high speed insertion (?80 mm/s), and release system to implant these shuttles. After implantation, the goal is for the shuttle to dissolve away leaving only the electrodes behind. Here we show the histology of chronically implanted shuttles of large (300 ?m × 125 ?m) and small (100 ?m × 125 ?m) size at discrete time points over 12 weeks. Early time points show the CMC shuttle expanded after insertion as it absorbed moisture from the brain and slowly dissolved. At later time points neuronal cell bodies populate regions within the original shuttle tract. The large CMC shuttles show that the CMC expansion can cause extended secondary damage. On the other hand, the smaller CMC shuttles show limited secondary damage, wound closure by 4 weeks, absence of activated microglia at 12 weeks, as well as evidence suggesting neural regeneration at the implant site. This shuttle, therefore, shows great promise facilitating the implantation of nontraditional ultra-small, and ultra-compliant probes.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art light and electron microscopes are capable of acquiring large image datasets, but quantitatively evaluating the data often involves manually annotating structures of interest. This process is time-consuming and often a major bottleneck in the evaluation pipeline. To overcome this problem, we have introduced the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS), a machine learning tool that leverages limited number of manual annotations in order to train a classifier and segment the remaining data automatically. In addition, TWS can provide unsupervised segmentation learning schemes (clustering) and can be customized to employ user-designed image features or classifiers. TWS is distributed as open-source software as part of the Fiji image processing distribution of ImageJ at http://imagej.net/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation. ignacio.arganda@ehu.eus Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract        = {Microglia cells are the major orchestrator of the brain inflammatory response. As such, they are traditionally studied in various contexts of trauma, injury, and disease, where they are well-known for regulating a wide range of physiological processes by their release of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and trophic factors, among other crucial mediators. In the last few years, however, this classical view of microglia was challenged by a series of discoveries showing their active and positive contribution to normal brain functions. In light of these discoveries, surveillant microglia are now emerging as an important effector of cellular plasticity in the healthy brain, alongside astrocytes and other types of inflammatory cells. Here, we will review the roles of microglia in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and their regulation by inflammation during chronic stress, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular emphasis on their underlying molecular mechanisms and their functional consequences for learning and memory.},

  abstract     = {Microglia are the resident macrophage population of the central nervous system (CNS). Adequate microglial function is crucial for a healthy CNS. Microglia are not only the first immune sentinels of infection, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune responses locally, but are also involved in the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Emerging data are showing new and fundamental roles for microglia in the control of neuronal proliferation and differentiation, as well as in the formation of synaptic connections. While microglia have been studied for decades, a long history of experimental misinterpretation meant that their true origins remained debated. However, recent studies on microglial origin indicate that these cells in fact arise early during development from progenitors in the embryonic yolk sac (YS) that seed the brain rudiment and, remarkably, appear to persist there into adulthood. Here, we review the history of microglial cells and discuss the latest advances in our understanding of their origin, differentiation, and homeostasis, which provides new insights into their roles in health and disease.},
